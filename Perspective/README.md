# Perspective
Typescript and SVG experiment

This project allows the user to draw polygons in perspective with two vanishing points.
The user sets the center of vision before placing polygons.
Very experimental and doesn't support crossing over the center line.

Example:
![Example Image](example.png "Perspective drawing")

- You can download and open index.html to run as is.
- If you would like to edit the typescript, then you will have to recompile it with 'tsc ./scripts/main.ts'
- Lastly, if you run the project with [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com "Caddy Server Website") then the Caddyfile will recompile the typescript each time you start the server

Potential Updates:
- Add color
- Allow crossing of center line
