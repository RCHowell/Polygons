# Polydraw
Typescript and SVG experiment

This project allows the user to draw polygons and create drawings. Color of the current polygon can be changed by pressing 'enter' while placing the shape. Press 'space' to place the last point of the shape.

Example:

![Example Image](example.png "Drawing made with this application")

- You can download and open index.html to run as is.
- If you would like to edit the typescript, then you will have to recompile it with 'tsc ./scripts/main.ts'
- Lastly, if you run the project with [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com "Caddy Server Website") then the Caddyfile will recompile the typescript each time you start the server
