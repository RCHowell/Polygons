# Triangles
Typescript and SVG experiment

This project allows the user to draw triangles and create drawings. Color of the current triangle can be changed by tapping the spacebar while placing the shape.

- You can download and open index.html to run as is.
- If you would like to edit the typescript, then you will have to recompile it with 'tsc ./scripts/main.ts'
- Lastly, if you run the project with [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com "Caddy Server Website") then the Caddyfile will recompile the typescript each time you start the server
