# Polygons
Typescript and SVG experiment
This project divides the browser window into hundreds of polygons that form the classic 3D Cube illusion

- You can download and and just open index.html and it will run.
- If you would like to edit the typescript, then you will have to recompile it with 'tsc ./scripts/main.ts'
- Lastly, if you run the project with [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com "Caddy Server Website") then the Caddyfile will recompile the typescript each time you start the server
