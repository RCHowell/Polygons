# Polygons
Typescript and SVG experiments

Project to improve my typescript. These projects create polygons with SVG.js in all different ways.

For each project:
- You can download and open index.html to run as is.
- If you would like to edit the typescript, then you will have to recompile it with 'tsc ./scripts/main.ts'
- Lastly, if you run the project with [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com "Caddy Server Website") then the Caddyfile will recompile the typescript each time you start the server

Examples:
![Cubes Example](Cubes/example.png "Generated Cubes")
![Polydraw Example](Polydraw/example.png "Polydraw")
![Triangle Example](Triangles/example.png "Drawing With Only Triangles")
![Perspective Example](Perspective/example.png "Perspective Drawing")
